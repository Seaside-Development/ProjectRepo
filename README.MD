The Project is divided into two apps. 
A.	1 React Js,
B.	1 React Native,
The React JS Web App can function on Web clients, Android, IOS, Windows and MacOs, due to its PWA nature, whereas, the React Native version only works on Android and IOS respectively. We, therefore, say the React JS PWA can be treated as an app for all platforms. We created the react native app to try an framework that was flexible to our limitations yet allowing us to integrate with native features if need be. With our limited access to IOS and Mac devices using React Native allowed Seaside Development to share the code base, code once for android and IOS and take advantage of native features. The apps serve to show the capabilities of JavaScript as a platform for coding serious apps to do eCommerce on. I hope you do enjoy the apps

The seaside team is a truly capable team that caters to the demands of a growing market.

We do wish to thank Dr Thomas Canhao for the privilege of allowing us to experiment this semester with cross platform apps. Especially given the circumstances and actually catering to our needs.
