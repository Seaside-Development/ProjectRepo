The Project is divided into two apps. 
	1 React Js,
	1 React Native,
The React JS Web App can function on Web, Android, IOS, Windows and MacOs, due to its
PWA nature, whereas, the React Native only works on Android and IOS respectively.

I therefore say, the React JS PWA can be treated as an app for all platforms. We created the 
react native app to try a more native app, howver with limited ios access using react native
allowed Seaside Development to share the code base, code once for android and IOS and take advantage
of generally native feautures. The apps serve to show the capabilites of JavaScript as platform for coding serious apps to do
ecommerce on. I hope you do enjoy the apps

The seaside team is a truly capable team that caters to the demands of a growing market.

We do wish to thank Dr Thomas Canhao for the privilage of allowing us to experiment this semester
given the circumstances and for actually catering to our needs.
